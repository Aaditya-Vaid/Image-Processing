# Image-Processing
This was a course project under Professor Koteswar Rao Jerripothula.

In this project we conducted literature review on standard image segmentation techniques and specialized models for COD task and used advanced architectures like **BiRefNet** and **SINet-V2** to improve detection by capturing fine details and subtle edges. We then fine-tuned SINeT-V2 model on the COD10K dataset, which includes diverse high-resolution images for training on camouflage patterns.

We achieved 0.62 average IoU score with fine-tuned SINeT-V2 architecture compared to 0.80 average IoU score with BiRefNet architecture on COD10K dataset.
